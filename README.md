Hi, I am Kent, an aspiring data enthusiast driven by a curiosity for how data shapes the world. I will be sharing some work I did to exercise my abilities in data manipulation, analysis, and storytelling. I intend to deepen my knowledge in other areas of data like machine learning and artificial intelligence in the near future.
